# Unexpected-Communities
A project aimed at mining unexpected communities.

In order to mine twitter, you need to have the authorized keys.

These keys can be got from http://developer.twitter.com by registering yourself as a developer.

The keys are used to mine the content of twitter through the streaming API

We use a config.py file to store the keys to mine twitter. 

The keys which are recieved from twitter needs to be input here for the program to work.
